The worst thing since mad cow!

i played minecraft so much i turned into a cow
and now i'm using my knowledge of coffee beans to change minecraft entirely
but every nerd starts at level 1 and i'm learning how to properly mod.

you may find me on an average day grazing on grass, cyberbullying small children on minecraft, and writing poor jokes.
